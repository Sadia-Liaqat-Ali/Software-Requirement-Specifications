# ðŸ“‘ Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

Welcome to the **[Project Name] - SRS Repository** ðŸŽ¯  
This repository contains the complete **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** for the project, including functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, and system models.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Why SRS?
The **SRS** is the foundation of the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.  
It defines *what the system should do* before any design or coding begins.  
- Ensures **clear communication** between stakeholders, clients, and developers.  
- Reduces misunderstandings and costly changes during development.  
- Acts as a **baseline** for design, coding, and testing.
